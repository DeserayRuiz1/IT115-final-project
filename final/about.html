       <p>&nbsp;Hello Everyone! My name is Deseray but you can call me Desi (for short).  I am the founder of Northwest Hikes and I love to take pictures of nature, scenery, view of the skies, etc. I have been a Washingtonian for the last 15+ years of my life. I am originally from Phoenix, AZ but I just can't leave the PNW alone!    </p>

        &nbsp;This is one of my favorite photos! Lilly and I went to Ocean Shores, WA about several years ago. WE woke up at 6am to see low tide creatures such as sand dollars, crabs, and starfishes. We had an amazing trip and I would recommend this trip to other individuals who are looking to play in water and relax on the beach!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The Interurban Trail between Seattle and Everett stitches together a dense residential and commercial patchwork that the original electric railway helped to grow in the early part of the 20th century. The 24-mile trail also goes through the communities of Shoreline, Mountlake Terrace, Edmonds, and Lynnwood.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp; This trail offers a lot of beautiful scenery along this route and is located near city limits. I would recommend checking out this trail during our gorgeous summers!
