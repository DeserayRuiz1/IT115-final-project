        <main> <h1> Welcome to Northwest Hikes! </h1>
        
       <p>&nbsp;Thank you for stopping by our page! My name is Deseray and I am the founder of Northwest Hikes. We are planning to bring you new photos of scenery, hikes and beautful nature shots from the Pacific Northwest area. </p>
    
    <p>
        &nbsp;I decided to showcase more photos of the Pacific Northwest nature, scenery and hikes. Lately, I am trying to find more time to hike. I really enjoy hiking with my daughter Lilly and my boyfriend, Andrew.  </p>    
        
            
        
        <h2> Featured Location:</h2>
            
        <p>&nbsp;Richmond Beach Park is located in Shoreline, WA. This park offers a nice ocean view of the Puget Sound that is near by railroad tracks. The park has two restrooms, kid-friendly equipment and a large staircase for excerise purposes.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;One morning, I woke up and decided to check instagram as I had a few notifications. I was greeted with a message from one of my followers. She was telling me to become a full-time photographer based on this photo.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;Because of her encouragement, I decided to use photography as a means of relieving stress and excerise. Thank you Chamburi for your believing in my photography skills more than me.
